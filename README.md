Klok
====
A smartwatch firmware with a focus on showing time.


Project
-------
In this project I want to create a smartwatch firmware for showing the current time. I bought the PineTime smartwatch with the intention to write some interesting software as a pastime. Thw PineTime community is very welcoming for new ideas, but I want to focus on a simple one. I want to work in a agile way towards a functional watch.

Important ideas for the project:

- Everything is under an open-source license and work on other projects is upstreamed.
- Code is in a modern, safe programming language (Rust). For now the underlaying OS is not as I think this is currently not feasible.
- Automated testing should prevent the user from receiving a bad firmware.
- Compatibility with other hardware is preferred. The current focus is PineTime, but choices made should allow other hardware as well.

Current state
-------------
For now it is just ideas and a prototype that doesn't show the time yet.

Name
----
The name "Klok" comes from the Dutch word for clock. It is also a posh word for watch.
